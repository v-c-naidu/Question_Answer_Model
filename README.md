# Technologies Used

1. **Tesseract-OCR** for image to Text conversion for Image documents.you can download it [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
2. **Pytorch** Machine Learning frame work.
3. **Transformers** is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.
4. **BERT**(Bidirectional Transformners) : A pretrained model by google used for language understanding.
5. **[deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2)** is the pretrained model used in this project.which is trained on *SQUAD2* dataset by Stanford University.
6. **Flask** framework of python is used for backend development.*HTML* and *CSS* are used for frontend.
